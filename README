netcat6 is a simple netcat clone, with IPv6 support. Currently, I have
tested it only in a Linux environment, but it should work with minor
modifications on other Unix platforms too.

You are encouraged to send me bug reports for netcat6 or suggestions 
on how to improve it (desired features and stuff like that).
