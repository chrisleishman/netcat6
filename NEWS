0.2pre4 

This release introduces the interesting timeout mode and features a 
state-of-the-art UDP support. From this release nc6 uses, if present, 
the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag of getaddrinfo for the connect mode. This changes 
the stupid use-IPv6-by-default behaviour that is harmful if your system
supports IPv6 but you don't have a global-scope IPv6 address configured 
on your machine.
Now file transfer mode works also with UDP. The configuration process has 
been greatly improved.


0.2pre3

This release introduces an interesting mode for file transfers in TCP and 
features many other minor enhancements in the code.


0.2pre2

This release finally introduces a good UDP support. Now netcat6 should 
also compile without problems on glibc 2.1 systems. The man page has also
been updated.


0.2pre1

This release introduces many bugfixes and some new features. Now netcat6 
makes use of GNU autoconf/automake to automate the configuration and 
build process.


0.1

This is a simple rewrite of netcat with advanced handling of internal
buffers. It supports only TCP.
